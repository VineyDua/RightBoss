## Blockers / Risks

No blockers or risks identified at this time.

## Notes for Next Steps

### For Task 2.1 (In Progress)
- Installing required testing packages (Jest, RTL, MSW)
- Creating Jest configuration file with proper TypeScript and Vite integration
- Setting up test utilities for component rendering
- Implementing initial API mocking configuration
- Creating example tests for a simple UI component, a service function, and a custom hook

### For Task 2.2 (Upcoming)
- Refining the component usage analysis from Task 1.1
- Creating detailed matrix of component properties, dependencies, and usage patterns
- Identifying common patterns across components to inform consolidation
- Documenting components that can be standardized vs. specialized

### For Task 2.3 (Upcoming)
- Review current authentication implementations
- Design clean API for auth service with proper separation of concerns
- Implement methods for user authentication, session management, and permission checks
- Create unit tests for auth service methods
