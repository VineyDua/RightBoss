# Testing Strategy for RightBoss Candidate Portal

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the RightBoss Candidate Portal, focusing on ensuring code quality, reliability, and maintainability as we refactor and improve the architecture.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid model:

1. **Unit Tests** (70%): Testing individual components, hooks, and utility functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** (20%): Testing interactions between components and services
3. **End-to-End Tests** (10%): Testing complete user flows and critical paths

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Primary test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For API mocking
- **Jest Coverage**: For tracking test coverage

## Testing Scope

### Unit Tests
- Components: Render tests, interaction tests, snapshot tests
- Hooks: Functionality tests
- Utility Functions: Input/output tests
- Services: API call tests with mocked responses

### Integration Tests
- Page components with service interactions
- Multi-component workflows
- State management across components

### End-to-End Tests
- Critical user flows (authentication, profile updating, job application)
- Cross-browser compatibility for essential features

## Test Data Strategy

- Mock data will be stored in dedicated fixture files
- Test data generators will be created for common entities
- Sensitive data will be mocked with realistic but fictional values

## Mocking Strategy

- External API calls will be mocked using MSW
- Supabase interactions will be consistently mocked
- Authentication will be mocked with different user roles

## Test Coverage Goals

- Overall code coverage target: 80%
- Critical modules coverage target: 90%
- New code coverage requirement: 85%

## Testing Conventions

### File Organization
- Tests located in `__tests__` directories adjacent to source files
- Test utilities in a central `/test-utils` directory
- Fixtures in a central `/fixtures` directory

### Naming Conventions
- Test files: `[filename].test.tsx` or `[filename].test.ts`
- Integration tests: `[feature].integration.test.tsx`
- End-to-end tests: `[flow].e2e.test.tsx`

### Test Structure
- Use descriptive test blocks with proper nesting
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Group related tests for readability

## CI/CD Integration

- Tests will run on all pull requests
- Failed tests will block merging
- Test coverage reports will be generated for each PR
- Regular scheduled runs of end-to-end tests

## Maintenance Strategy

- Automated detection of flaky tests
- Quarterly review of testing strategy
- Regular updates to testing libraries
- Documentation of common testing patterns

## Training and Support

- Testing documentation for new team members
- Example tests for different scenarios
- Code review checklist for test quality

## Phase-Specific Priorities

### Phase 1: Audit and Planning
- Create testing strategy document
- Evaluate existing tests
- Identify test coverage gaps

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure
- Set up testing framework
- Create testing utilities
- Document testing patterns

### Phase 3: Component Testing
- Develop tests for core components
- Set up component testing library
- Create component test templates

### Phase 4: Integration and E2E Testing
- Set up integration testing framework
- Create critical path E2E tests
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
